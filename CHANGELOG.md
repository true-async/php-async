    - Efficient caching of event handlers to reduce EventLoop creation overhead
    - Poll proxy event aggregation and improved lifecycle management

### Fixed

    - The add/dispose methods correctly increment the counter
    - Memory leaks fixed
- Fixed await iterator logic for `awaitXXX` functions
- Fixed process waiting logic for UNIX-like systems

### Changed

    - Optimized waker trigger structures with improved memory layout
    - Enhanced memory management for poll proxy events
    - Better resource cleanup and lifecycle management
- **Event Loop Performance**: Major scheduler optimizations
    - **Automatic Event Cleanup**: Added automatic waker event cleanup when coroutines resume (see `ZEND_ASYNC_WAKER_CLEAN_EVENTS`)
    - Separate queue implementation for resumed coroutines to improve stability
    - Reduced unnecessary LibUV calls in scheduler tick processing
- **Socket Performance**:
    - Event handler caching for sockets to avoid constant EventLoop recreation
    - Optimized `network_async_accept_incoming` to try `accept()` before waiting
    - Enhanced stream_select functionality with event-driven architecture
    - Improved blocking operation handling with boolean return values
- **TrueAsync API Performance**: Optimized execution paths by replacing expensive `EG(exception)` checks with direct `bool` return values across all async functions
- Upgrade `LibUV` to version `1.45` due to a timer bug that causes the application to hang

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-16

### Added
- Docker support with multi-stage build (Ubuntu 24.04, libuv 1.49, curl 8.10)
- PDO MySQL and MySQLi async support
- **TrueAsync API Extensions**: Enhanced async API with new object creation and coroutine grouping capabilities
    - Added `ZEND_ASYNC_NEW_GROUP()` API for creating CoroutineGroup objects for managing multiple coroutines
    - Added `ZEND_ASYNC_NEW_FUTURE_OBJ()` and `ZEND_ASYNC_NEW_CHANNEL_OBJ()` APIs for creating Zend objects from async primitives
    - Extended `zend_async_task_t` structure with `run` method for thread pool task execution
    - Enhanced `zend_async_scheduler_register()` function with new API function pointers
- **Multiple Callbacks Per Event Support**: Complete redesign of waker trigger system to support multiple callbacks on a single event
    - Modified `zend_async_waker_trigger_s` structure to use flexible array member with dynamic capacity
    - Added `waker_trigger_create()` and `waker_trigger_add_callback()` helper functions for efficient memory management
    - Implemented single-block memory allocation for better performance (trigger + callback array in one allocation)
    - Default capacity starts at 1 and doubles as needed (1 → 2 → 4 → 8...)
    - Fixed `coroutine_event_callback_dispose()` to remove only specific callbacks instead of entire events
    - **Breaking Change**: Events now persist until all associated callbacks are removed
- **Bailout Tests**: Added 15 tests covering memory exhaustion and stack overflow scenarios in async operations
- **Garbage Collection Support**: Implemented comprehensive GC handlers for async objects
    - Added `async_coroutine_object_gc()` function to track all ZVALs in coroutine structures
    - Added `async_scope_object_gc()` function to track ZVALs in scope structures  
    - Proper GC tracking for context HashTables (values and keys)
    - GC support for finally handlers, exception handlers, and function call parameters
    - GC tracking for waker events, internal context, and nested async structures
    - Prevents memory leaks in complex async applications with circular references
- **Key Order Preservation**: Added `preserveKeyOrder` parameter to async await functions
    - Added `preserve_key_order` parameter to `async_await_futures()` API function
    - Added `preserve_key_order` field to `async_await_context_t` structure
    - Enhanced `awaitAll()`, `awaitAllWithErrors()`, `awaitAnyOf()`, and `awaitAnyOfWithErrors()` functions with `preserveKeyOrder` parameter (defaults to `true`)
    - Allows controlling whether the original key order is maintained in result arrays

### Fixed
- Memory management improvements for long-running async applications
- Proper cleanup of coroutine and scope objects during garbage collection cycles
- **Async Iterator API**:
    - Fixed iterator state management to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed the `spawnWith()` function for interaction with the `ScopeProvider` and `SpawnStrategy` interface
- **Build System Fixes**:
    - Fixed macOS compilation error with missing field initializer in `uv_stdio_container_t` structure (`libuv_reactor.c:1956`)
    - Fixed Windows build script PowerShell syntax error (missing `shell: cmd` directive)
    - Fixed race condition issues in 10 async test files for deterministic test execution on all platforms

### Changed
- **Breaking Change: Function Renaming** - Major API reorganization for better consistency:
    - `awaitAllFailFirst()` → `awaitAllOrFail()`
    - `awaitAllWithErrors()` → `awaitAll()` 
    - `awaitAnyOfFailFirst()` → `awaitAnyOfOrFail()`
    - `awaitAnyOfWithErrors()` → `awaitAnyOf()`
- **Breaking Change: `awaitAll()` Return Format** - New `awaitAll()` (formerly `awaitAllWithErrors()`) now returns `[results, exceptions]` tuple:
    - First element `[0]` contains array of successful results
    - Second element `[1]` contains array of exceptions from failed coroutines
    - **Migration**: Update from `$results = awaitAll($coroutines)` to `[$results, $exceptions] = awaitAll($coroutines)`
- **LibUV requirement increased to ≥ 1.44.0** - Requires libuv version 1.44.0 or later to ensure proper UV_RUN_ONCE behavior and prevent busy loop issues that could cause high CPU usage
- **Async Iterator API**:
    - Proper handling of `REWIND`/`NEXT` states in a concurrent environment. 
      The iterator code now stops iteration in 
      coroutines if the iterator is in the process of changing its position.
    - Added functionality for proper handling of exceptions from `Zend iterators` (`\Iterator` and `generators`).
      An exception that occurs in the iterator can now be handled by the iterator's owner.

  handle destructors that may suspend execution in async context

    - Automatically collects multiple exceptions from `onFinally` handlers in both Scope and Coroutine
    - Provides `addException()` method to add exceptions to the composite
