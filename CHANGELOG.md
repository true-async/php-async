## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - TBD

### Added
- Complete implementation of `onFinally()` method for `Async\Scope` class
- Cross-thread trigger event API
- Priority support to async iterator system
- Coroutine priority support to TrueAsync API
- **Iterator API integration**: Added `zend_async_iterator_t` structure to TrueAsync API with `run()` and `run_in_coroutine()` methods
- `disposeAfterTimeout()` method for Scope
- `awaitAfterCancellation()` method for Scope
- Complete Scope API implementation
- `Async\protect()` function
- Signal handlers support (UNIX)
- Coroutine class with full lifecycle management
- `onFinally()` logic for Coroutine class

### Changed
- Enhanced ZEND_ASYNC_NEW_SCOPE API to create Scope without Zend object for internal use
- Refactored catch_or_cancel logic according to RFC scope behavior
- Refactored async_scheduler_coroutine_suspend to support non-zero exception context
- Optimized iterator module
- **Iterator structure refactoring**: Made `async_iterator_t` compatible with `zend_async_iterator_t` API by adding function pointer methods
- Improved exception handling and cancellation logic
- Enhanced Context API behavior for Scope

### Fixed
- Multiple fixes for Scope dispose operations
- Fixed scope_try_to_dispose logic
- Spawn tests fixes

- Nanosecond support for async timer events
- Stream socket tests and functionality
- PHP_POLL2 implementation and tests
- `cancel_on_exit` option for `async_await_futures`
- Context API with HashTable optimization
- Coroutine Internal context support

### Changed
- Refactored sockets extension to use new TrueAsync API

### Fixed
- Multiple memory leaks
- DNS API bugs and errors
- Stream tests fixes
