Scope: onFinally() - basic execution of finally handler

<?php

$coroutine = $scope->spawn(function() {
    echo "Coroutine started\n";

// You should understand that this handler will be invoked in a different coroutine,
// so you cannot rely on the exact timing of when it will happen.

--EXPECT--
Coroutine started
Finally handler executed
