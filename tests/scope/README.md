## Running Tests

To run these tests:

```bash
# Run all scope tests
make test TESTS="ext/async/tests/scope/"

# Run specific test
make test TESTS="ext/async/tests/scope/001-scope_construct_basic.phpt"
```

## Notes

- These tests cover the complete Scope API functionality
- Includes comprehensive finally handler support with CompositeException handling
- Features full garbage collection support to prevent memory leaks in scoped async operations
- Tests should be run in a properly configured async environment
- Exception handling and timeout functionality is fully implemented and tested
